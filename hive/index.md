# Vision 
At the Hub of Immersive Virtual Environments, our vision is to be at the forefront of research in multimodal interaction and immersive technologies.  

We aspire to lead the way in creating extraordinary, immersive experiences across diverse application domains, pushing the boundaries of human-computer interaction and redefining the possibilities of immersion in a digital world.  

We aim to be a trusted resource for industry and academia, helping to drive advancements that have a tangible impact on a variety of sectors.  

# Mission
Our mission at the Hub of Immersive Virtual Environments is to drive innovation through rigorous research and experimentation.We are dedicated to exploring, developing, and harnessing cutting-edge technologies to advance the state of immersive visualization and intuitive interaction.  

Through collaboration, experimentation, and a commitment to excellence, we seek to empower our community, our partners, and the world at large with transformative insights and solutions that enhance the way we connect with technology, information, and each other.

# Our Research Focus
At the HIVE, we investigate avenues of multimodal interaction for developing enriched experiences. Primarily, our work is focused in four broad areas.  
|Virtual and Augmented Reality |Haptic Interaction|Brain Computer Interfaces |Computer Graphics / Vision|
